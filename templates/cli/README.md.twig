## Installation

This tutorial assumes that you have docker setup and running on your machine. 

```bash
$ wget -q https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh  -O - | /bin/bash  
```

## Initialisation 
The CLI needs to be initialised with your project settings. This can be done using 
```sh
$ appwrite init 
```

The CLI requires an endpoint, project ID, API key and a locale to be able to communicate with the Appwrite backend server. There are two ways to achieve this 

### 1. Environment file 
```sh
$ appwrite --env-file path/to/your/environment/file init     
```
The .env file must have the following keys 
```sh
endpoint=http://192.168.1.6/v1
X-Appwrite-Project=5ff450422d42f
X-Appwrite-Key=0773c7...a2672a
X-Appwrite-Locale=en-US
```

### 2. Using the prompt

Invoking `appwrite init` without an env file triggers an interactive prompt where you can manually enter the details. These values are saved locally so that you dont have to re-enter them everytime. 

## Usage 

The Appwrite CLI follows the following general syntax.
```sh
$ appwrite [SERVICE] [COMMAND] --[OPTIONS]
```

A few sample commands to get you started 

```sh
$ appwrite users create --email="hello@appwrite.io" --password="very_strong_password"
$ appwrite users list 
```

To get information about the different services available, you can use 
```sh
$ appwrite help
```

To get information about a particular service and the commands available in a service you can use 
```sh
$ appwrite users help
$ appwrite accounts help
```

To get information about a particular command and the parameters it accepts, you can use

```sh
$ appwrite users list --help
$ appwrite account get --help 
```
